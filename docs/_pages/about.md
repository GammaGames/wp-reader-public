## Who

I am Jesse Lieberg, I wrote the python script that populates this site's content. All content belongs to respective authors and copyright holders on [/r/WritingPrompts](https://reddit.com/r/writingprompts).  
You can find out more about me on my personal site, [GammaGames.net](https://gammmagames.net), or contact me on [Reddit <i class="fab fa-reddit"></i>](https://reddit.com/u/GammaGames) or [Twitter <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/GammaGames).

## What

This site that pulls the weekly schedule posts from [/r/WritingPrompts](https://reddit.com/r/writingprompts) and displays all top-level comments in order from oldest to newest.  
Again, content belongs to authors and copyright holders. No data is archived.

## Where

The site source code is available on [GitHub <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/GammaGames/wp-reader-public).  
If you have any problems, feel free to open an issue on the repo or contact Jesse directly.

## When

The site updates at regular intervals using GitHub actions. You can find the schedule on the [workflow page](https://github.com/GammaGames/wp-reader-public/blob/master/.github/disabled-workflows/update.yaml).

## Why

Reading the submitted stories was annoying on mobile, so I hacked this together in a few hours.
